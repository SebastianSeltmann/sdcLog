We provide

 - formally anonymized confidential microdata
 - to researchers

# What do I do?

We provide

 - formally anonymized confidential microdata
 - to researchers
 - in a secure environment (no internet, ...)

Before researchers receive their research results, we need to check if the
results contain any confidential information.

It's the researchers duty to show that their results are not confidential.

This is where `sdcLog` comes into play.

# A tiny bit of theory

Two simple rules:

**1. Each result must be based on at least 5 different entities.**

# A tiny bit of theory

Two simple rules:

**1. Each result must be based on at least 5 different entities.**

**2. The largest two entities must account for less than 85% of a result (dominance).**

# An example

```{r sdc_descriptives_1, echo=3}
data("sdc_descriptives_DT")
DT <- sdc_descriptives_DT
head(DT)
```

---

# An example

```{r sdc_descriptives_2, echo=3}
data("sdc_descriptives_DT")
DT <- sdc_descriptives_DT
head(DT)
```

```{r sdc_descriptives_3}
# results wanted
DT[, .(mean = mean(val_1, na.rm = TRUE)), by = "sector"]
```

---

# An example

```{r sdc_descriptives_4, echo=3}
data("sdc_descriptives_DT")
DT <- sdc_descriptives_DT
head(DT)
```

```{r sdc_descriptives_5}
# results wanted
DT[, .(mean = mean(val_1, na.rm = TRUE)), by = "sector"]
```

```{r sdc_descriptives_6}
# show that this result is fine
sdc_descriptives(DT, id_var = "id", val_var = "val_1", by = "sector")
```

---

# Another example
```{r sdc_descriptives_7}
sdc_descriptives(DT, id_var = "id", val_var = "val_1", by = c("sector", "year"))
```

# Other functionality

`sdc_model()` for disclosure control of models

`sdc_min_max()` for non-confidential min/max values
